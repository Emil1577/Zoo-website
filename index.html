        <p> Dogs are the canine companions who have shared our lives for millennia.
            Ranging from tiny Chihuahuas to enormous Great Danes and every breed and magnificent mutt in between, dogs are an incredibly diverse species. Our best friends and furry family members provide us affection and companyâ€”but many dogs face neglect, exploitation and cruelty both here and abroad.</p>
